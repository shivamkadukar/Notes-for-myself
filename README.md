## Introduction -
-----

This repository contains notes, code snippet and syntax, installation process or anything tech related which I usually come across in my day to day experience.

## Aim -
------

The aim of creating this repository is to have all the necessary information at one place. These is created with the intention of getting the information in one place to save the time of visiting websites and reading documentation when I come across a problem which I have already tackled earlier. The repo is not intended to for adding course notes but only for the very important info for which i had to look over various websites an trial and errors to get thing doen correctly.

## __Information_about_file_nomenclature__ -
-------------------------------------------

* The folder naming schema is decided to keep same throughout the addition of files to this repo.

* The file name will start with a verb which defines the purpose of the work like _installing_, _creating_, etc.

* And the next word in combination with the verb will give the overall idea of the purpose of that file.
so the file nomenclature will be as _Installing_Linux_, _Creating_virtual_environment_, etc.

* Also the snake case type naming method will be followed for naming the files.

These steps are to be taken while naming the files so that it will be easier to search for the required file when the number of files will grow.
