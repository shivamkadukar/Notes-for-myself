# Fixing pendrive showing less total memory that its actually capacity

Sometimes windows cannot recognize a partition on a pendrive when there are more than one partitions.

* open cmd and run the commands belows

'''bash
diskpart
'''

'''bash
list disk
'''
this will list all the internal and external disk on the machine with a naming scheme as Disk 0, Disk 1 so on.

Select the pendrive by the following command

'''bash
SELECT DISK={number of the disk 0/1/2 whatever in the Disk### column}
'''

The pendrive will be selected

now run a command to clean the pendrive

'''bash
clean
'''

'''bash
create partition primary
'''

now the next command formats the pendrive so backup the data if its important

'''bash
format fs=ntfs quick
'''

the pendrive will be formatted and it will now show the original capacity of the pendrive.
